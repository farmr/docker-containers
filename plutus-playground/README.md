## Getting started

The Plutus Playground is written in [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) and uses npm and [spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago) for managing dependencies. It talks to the [plutus-playground-server](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-playground-server) which also needs to be up and running during development. The client build also depends on purescript files that are generated by the backend service using [purescript-bridge](https://github.com/eskimor/purescript-bridge).

**Note**: _The workflow described here relies heavily on Nix. This means you should either be working inside a nix-shell environment or use tools such as [lorri](https://github.com/target/lorri) or [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) or similar to provide a suitable environment.

## Starting the Plutus playground server

```bash
$ plutus-playground-server
```

The `plutus-playground-server` script is provided by the global [shell.nix](../shell.nix) and starts the server (If the command
is not available make sure you are in a nix-shell session or that lorri is ready). For additional information on invoking the backend server please refer to its [README.md](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-playground-server/README.md).


## Starting the Plutus playground client

With the backend server running you can get started using the `npm start` script:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

The `start` script will:

- Install npm dependencies
- Generate purescript bridge code
- Compile the purescript code
- Start the webkpack server

Once the `start` script completes you can access the frontend via [http://localhost:8009](http://localhost:8009)

## Starting the Plutus playground with docker-compose

From the plutus-playground folder :

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
